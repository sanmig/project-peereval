PeerEval
========

This framework is based on Symfony, PHP Mailer, and Doctrine.

This Project opportunity has arisen due to the increasing amounts of collaborative work that is being undertaken both in educaiton and work environments. Our client, a senior academic staff member at WelTec has seen that there is a need for a more automated, computer base system for peer evaluating to be undertaken.

Goal
----

-	Implement a peer evaluation app into the WelTec system
-	Low adminstrative and maintenance work
-	Acurracy
-	Inciting participation
-	Enforcing honesty
-	Captivation
